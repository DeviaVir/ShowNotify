// Here's where we define some default constants
@import partials/base

// Then we'll import the compass extension
//@import html5-boilerplate

// Now, you can simply include everything
// (except print and helpers) by uncommeting this line
//@include html5-boilerplate;

// Or, you can pick and choose only the sections
// you want by using the this include

// @html5-boilerplate-normalize(html5, base, selection, links, typography, lists, images, svg, figures, forms, tables)

// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins
//@import "partials/overrides";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)
@import partials/normalize
@import partials/formalize
// @import partials/fonts
@import partials/animations
@import kube/main
@import partials/page

// Helpers classes should come second-to-last

// @html5-boilerplate-helpers(ir, hidden, visuallyhidden, invisible, clearfix)

// Media should come last
@import partials/media
